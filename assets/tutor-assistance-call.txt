Please provide us with your Problem Statement. This is a clear description of the problem that you're currently facing.
For example, if you're working on a piece of code that isn't behaving as expected, what should the code be doing, and what is it actually doing?
I have written my code in replit because of this error in gitpod but I was hoping Heruko would be ok.... it's not. It can't display my game

What steps have you taken so far to resolve the issue, or to address current gaps in your knowledge?
googling see other posts but no real help

how to fix it

One final thing. Please share your code with us, if possible. 
If you are working on Gitpod, please set your workspace to shared, and send us the link to it. If you are working on a course challenge, please send the name of the challenge. If you are seeing any errors, please send a screenshot.

Hi Liam,
ï»¿PyGame is a desktop application, and as I understand it it requires so particular modules (software) to run in the browser, I am already aware that replit has something special going on with allows this, but heroku I know for a fact does not, many students that try to build GUI applications will not manage to get them working on heroku, the likely culprit in tkinter that cause the issue.
right, so what do i do? The vast majority of my project is done
Sean profile
I would need to ask the assessments team about whether you could submit using replit, but I'm not 100% that is the case.
ï»¿Sadly, before you started the project, because you were using a program designed for desktop and not the web, there was going to be a chance that it would not deploy and you could have checked before hand. ðŸ™‚
ï»¿
ï»¿Which project is this for? PP3?
I checked with my mentor, he had no issues with it
yes project 3
pp3 is a console / terminal application, and a user interface is not needed, there is a template provided to help with deploying it as well.
ï»¿
ï»¿PyGame is not covered in the course, nor are desktop applications, and as much as I would like to help you. Tutor Support cannot give help / support with deployment of PyGame.
ï»¿
ï»¿I am yet to see a student that has used PyGame in a project and deployed successfully.
Sean profile
What i can do, is ask the assessment team about other deployment options, is another user able to access the replit version?
the replit version is just open on my user. What i'm angry about is i wasn't told about pygame not working.
I have until sunday to submit!
I'm still working on it but
https://replit.com/@LiamSmith3194/Python-in-Python#main.py
Sean profile
I cannot access that sadly.
what about this
https://replit.com/join/gyweyafvik-liamsmith3194
that's a join link
Sean profile
Im not 100% on that, you said that you have until Sunday, do you mean tomorrow?
Monday 12.00 deadline
I work mon-fri
so I have the rest of today and tomorrow
Sean profile
As its the weekend, i cant get in touch with anyone from that team, it would be first thing on Monday morning, the same goes for the Student Support team.
ï»¿
ï»¿Essentially the assessment team needs your application to be publically accessable.
ok, but it's too late by then
Sean profile
I understand, but pygame does not run on heroku, so you will need to have it on some platform that is public.
ï»¿The best that I can do, is refer you to Student Care and have them contact the assessment team with a solution unless you manage to get it working somehow.
ok, well i add this "join" link in the readme file because i don't see how i will get this to work.
Sean profile
Do you have to be online for that link to work?
what do you mean by online ?
it's a link to the replit website
I mean, logged in and that you are online at the same time that someone "joins"
Sean profile
You cant possibly know when the project will be accessed so it would need to be available without you being online and logged into replit

thats what replit says
shall i log out and see if you can view it?
Sean profile
sure..
ok ive logged out
Sean profile
ok, yes, i can log in and see your game
ok, well that's something i guess
Sean profile
That is something, what ill do is flag you for student care to ring first thing on Monday morning, and they will contact the assessment team, in the meantime, I would leave instructions in your readme of how to start and play the game from within replit, and also outline why you cannot use heroku.
ok, thank you.
Obviously make them aware that submission is 12.00, therefore I will submit either tonight or tomorrow regardless
Sean profile
Will do, thank you.
thanks Sean
Sean profile
Ive sent off that request, someone should contact you first thing on monday.
ok thank you
Just now. Seen
